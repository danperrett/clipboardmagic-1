2	SOFTWARE MODULE TESTS
Test No.	Test Description
1	Main Processing Loop Functionality
(i)	Check that all channels of appropriate type are scanned and any received messages are extracted from the relevant input queue
(ii)	Check that messages with an unknown classification are ignored
2	Device Status Update
SU Message ? Function DeviceStatusUpdate
For each of the different device types:
(i)	Check that a message of incorrect length is ignored 
(ii)	Check that an update is ignored if the device record number is invalid 
(iii)	Check that the correct device array record is updated with the new status data and a flag set for the device type for action by the DEVICE process.
3	Train Move
CA Message ? Function TrainMove
(i)	Check that a message of incorrect length is ignored 
(ii)	Check that an invalid berth Id?s are ignored
(iii)	Check that a valid message updates the correct BARRAY records with the correct data.
4	Train Cancel
CB Message ? Function TrainCancel
(i)	Check that a message of incorrect length is ignored 
(ii)	Check that an invalid berth Id is ignored
(iii)	Check that a valid message updates the correct BARRAY record with the correct data.
5	Train Interpose
CC Message ? Function TrainInterpose
(i)	Check that a message of incorrect length is ignored 
(ii)	Check that an invalid berth Id is ignored
(iii)	Check that a valid message updates the correct BARRAY record with the correct data.

This should allow multiple connection to connect, at TCP level found bug, but I?ve tried to contact Dave about to get more clarifications about how it?s meant to work.

The MASTER/Standby should flip between both now. 

And things are queued to MCS properly

The signing takes place in two steps and the verification of the signing is the reverse of the
