This case is not actually one that?s been tested here for a while as it has not been validated and would not have been run by Sama in regression testing.
I did manage to get him to run this test case on a Samsung Galaxy s4 and the test results are doing the same as they are now which is try and reselect after the TAU update.
I don?t know why this is I?ll need to investigate further. was there a HDI raise for this?
