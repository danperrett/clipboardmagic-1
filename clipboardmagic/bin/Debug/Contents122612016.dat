has been designed to meet the requirements for SIL2 software development as per EN 50128(2011)

1.1	Security Considerations
The protection mechanisms used, being a sequence number, timeout and XML signing, meet the EN50159 criteria of sequence number (7.3.1), timeout (7.3.3) and cryptographic techniques (7.3.8) and so, as depicted in the threat/defence matrix (7.4.2), provide protection against all seven threats.  Specifically, 
?	the sequence number implemented in the ICONIS Interface module protects against repetition, re-sequencing, insertion and deletion,
?	the timeout in the TCP Handler module protects against delay (out of date data),
?	the XML signing protects against corruption and masquerade.
XML signing is a type A1 security mechanism as described in EN50159 clause C2 and is therefore suitable for use in systems where unauthorised access cannot be excluded.
The NVFB3 protocol is used for rail state information and control requests passed between the Safety Gateway and the SSL S-RIF.  This provides additional protection against six of the seven threats.
