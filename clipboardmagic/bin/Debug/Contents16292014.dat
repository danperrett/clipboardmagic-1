			1 - AttachIgnoreExample.ISC	LTE: 7 	Example Interactive Programmed Play Script. Start of waiting for and Attach Request which it will reject then immediately update the cell, to Ignore the next request. Once the next Attach Request has been ignored it will update the Cell to Reject the next Attach Request.This continues until the end where a Post Process analysis takes place which will count then number of attach requests and measure the time between them.	Supported and Verified	
			2 - AttachDetach.ISC	LTE: 7 	Basic Attach Detach example  Interactive Programmed Play Script. Activates Cell A, waits for 'Attach Complete', sends network detach, wait for 'Connection Release', then deactivates cell.	Supported and Verified	
			3 - WaitForTackingAreaUpdate.ISC	LTE: 7 	Wait for Tracking Area Update example  Interactive Programmed Play Script. Activates Cell, sets inactivity timer to 5 sec,  waits for 'Attach Complete', waits for the 'Release' to occur. Then will wait for the 'Tracking Area Update '. After this has happened the 'Network Detach' will happen and then the cell is deactivated.	Supported and Verified	
			4 - HandoverCellAtoB.ISC	LTE: 7 	Handover from Cell A to B example  Interactive Programmed Play Script.  Activate Cell A and Cell B, wait for 'Attach Complete' on cell A, intiate network handover to cell B, wait for 'Reconfigure' to Cell B then initiate Network Detach.	Supported and Verified	
			5 - AttachIgnoreExample-Exp.ISC	LTE: 7 	Shortended version of Example Script 1. The Scenarios and cell definitions are Explicitly defined within the script file, so it does not rely on outside files.	Supported
